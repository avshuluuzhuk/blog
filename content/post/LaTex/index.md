## LaTex. Markup language

TEX is a publishing system created by the American mathematician and programmer Donald E. Knuth. TEX was developed with two main goals in mind:

- allow everyone to create high-quality publications with reasonable efforts for this;

- provide a tool that allows you to create externally identical publications on all computers in the present and in the future.

TEX is famous for its extreme stability, working on various types of computers and almost complete absence of errors.
The TEX version number tends to Ï€ and is now equal to 3.14159.
In many technical communities, especially computer,
mathematical, physical and chemical, TEX is recognized
as a de facto standard. A huge number of books are published using TEX
including books published by Cambridge University Press,
Elsever, Oxford University Press or Springer. A large number of scientific and technical journals are published using TEX, allowing authors of publications should send their articles directly in the TEX document format
LATEX (in the ASCII environment, LaTeX is written) is a markup language and
a document preparation system that uses TEX as a layout engine. LATEX automates many aspects of document layout, such
as automatic numbering of pages, tables, illustrations, formulas, cross-references, headers, footers, index, table of contents and references. The LATEX system additionally
contains a large set of TEX macros that facilitate the creation of complex documents. The first version of LATEX was written in 1984 by Leslie Lamport and has since become the dominant way of preparing TEX publications.
